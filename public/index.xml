      <description>I recently applied for an engineering management position at a maturing startup. The initial interview was great. We went an hour over the allotted time, and it felt like a friendly and meaningful conversation. In the end, the interviewer asked me if I would rather manage an existing team or kick-start a new one. I went for the second option and was looking forward to the next step in the process.</description>
