`satan's hackathon boilerplate shitpit co-lead developer`

> I am a winner, a Principal Software Engineer with tremendous experience. We're talking about over a decade of designing and building big league systems. You won't find anyone better, trust me. I know how to lead teams and get the job done, delivering top-notch, top-quality software on time and under budget. I know all the best languages and technologies, Java, C++, Python - you name it, I know it. I'm a great communicator, people tell me all the time, I can work with anyone, technical or not. I love solving problems and always stay ahead of the game, always learning, always winning. Believe me, I'm the best in the business.

Stalk me on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tsak). [This blog](https://github.com/tsak/tsak.dev) lives on Github until I can be bothered to change the Cloudflare pages setup to integrate with Codeberg.
